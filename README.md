# Rock Paper Scissors

The project is a browser version of Rock Paper Scissors. Instead of forming shapes with their hands the player can select a card to represent rock, paper, or scissors.

# Installation
After downloading the files, open the index.html file in your browser.

# How to Play
To start playing select one of the cards and click `Go!`. Clicking `Go!` signals the opponent to
play a card. If you would like to play again click `New Game`.
